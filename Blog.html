             <h1>TECHNOLOGY AND ITS IMPACT</h1>
             <p>
               It is no surprise that technology plays a crucial role in our society today.
               We live in a time when technological advancements happen on a daily basis.
               In just the last decade alone, the change in the way we communicate with each other
               or rely on certain devices like the smart phone which didn’t exist just a few decades ago is
               remarkable. Technology affects the way we learn and think nowadays.  However, it isn’t all positives,
               there are some serious impacts of this rapid growing technology in our daily lives as well.<br/><br/>

               The main way that technology has impacted our daily life is via communication and how we
               communicate with each other worldwide. Due to the rapid increase in technological development
               this trend of<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="hide">global communication is only increasing. For example,
               emails, social networking, video calls etc. has revolutionized the way we communicate with
               each other. Another aspect of technology that had a huge impact in our daily life is learning.
               Due to technologies like the internet, learning has become more interactive and collaborative
               and is helping students engage with the course material more intuitively. It has also provided
               students of all ages a golden opportunity to learn any skill at any time. Unlike traditional
               form of education, this modern way of learning gets us better access to resources. Similarly,
               teachers have the ability to conduct online classes, quizzes, tests and even exams. It encourages
               self-paced learning, which can be crucial to some students who take longer time to understand
               certain concepts than their peers. These technological advancements have made learning more
               approachable and convenient.<br><br>

               Additionally, the technological advancements that have been made in the health industry have been
               revolutionary. There are many innovate applications in both computers and mobile phones that we rely
               on daily that we now take granted for. Creative solutions such as calories intake, monitoring pulse
               and other health related systems that can be lifesaving. There’s also a lot of daily activities that
               we rely on such as smart phones. For example, listening to music, alarm, using
               the web, communication etc. we can do all of this from our mobile devices and because of it,
               technology has changed all of our lives.<br><br>

               However, Technology has had a very negative impact on our environment. Technology runs on electricity,
               and unfortunately most of our electricity still comes from fossil fuel, which are extremely dangerous to
               our environment. Similarly, as new technology comes around the old version of it is irrelevant and becomes
               waste that is dumped in sites. All of this pollution impacts us directly or indirectly in negative ways.
               Some studies have also shown that mobile devices affect people in a negative way as well. Mobile technology
               can decrease communication and relations between people and can make people more insecure. It is also often
               a major distraction from our schoolwork. Recently, due to the sharing of our personal
               data to large corporations like Facebook, there is also a loss of privacy. In the end though, we have to remember
               that without these technological advancements, our way of life would be very boring and mundane.<br><br></span>
